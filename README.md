# HWTBench (Hamburg Wheel Tracking on Asphalt Samples Dataset for ML Benchmarking)

## Description: üìù
The HWTBench dataset is a comprehensive collection of asphalt samples that have been tested using the Hamburg Wheel Machine (HWM) across multiple load stages. This dataset has been meticulously generated and curated for the purpose of benchmarking machine learning applications in the field of asphalt analysis and characterization.

The Hamburg Wheel Machine (HWM) is a well-established testing device specifically designed to simulate the effects of traffic loads on asphalt materials. It applies cyclic loads and wheel abrasion to assess the performance and durability of asphalt samples under various conditions. The dataset contains a wide range of asphalt specimens that have experienced rigorous testing on the HWM, providing diverse scenarios for machine learning evaluation.

The HWTBench dataset offers a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and data scientists working on machine-learning models for asphalt performance prediction and material analysis. This dataset allows users to develop and validate novel algorithms, models, and techniques for asphalt quality assessment and prediction.

## Description of files: ‚úçÔ∏è
The repository contains a directory named Images, which contains the asphalt sample images tested by the HWM. In three sub-directories, train (632), test(79), and val (79). All the images are two-dimensional color images with .jpg extension.

Also, this repository stores a file named best.pt, which contains the computed weights using the YOLOv3 framework (ultralytics/yolov3) by the authors. The retrieved weights are parameters related to the employment of CONCORNET2023.
